For example, here are some good guesses for questions 1 and 4:\n\nF50 - Ferrari\nF2002 - Ferrari\nF310 - Ferrari\nF2001 - Ferrari\n400 - Ferrari\n195 S - Ferrari\nF40 - Ferrari - or, since you know about the car, also Ferrari - or, because it has the \"F\" in the name, Ferrari. \n288 GTO - Ferrari - or, because the \"GT\" in the middle means supercar, Ferrari. \nCalifornia - Ferrari - probably not the model but definitely Ferrari - they were supercars.\n\nHowever, you cannot be 100% sure that each wrong answers is one of those choices. \n(Pssst! Don't tell anyone, but each wrong answer for the last question is in fact Ferrari. We know this because we wrote it.)\n\nA:\n\nFerrari \nFerrari did not exist when this quiz was authored, but is definitely correct.\n\nA:\n\nA guess, but I think I'll go for Porsche 944, since the question says developed by:\n\nQuestion: Porsche 944, developed by? \n\nI'm pretty sure Porsche is the manufacturer and all the rest is owned by other manufacturers.\n\nA:\n\nFor this last question:\nQuestion:  Porsche 944, developed by? \n\nMy best bet would be Porsche, so I guess Porsche 944.\n\n<|endoftext|>"}, {"case_id": 5, "requested_rewrite": {"prompt": ["The mother tongue of {} is"], "subject": ["Thomas Joannes Stieltjes"], "relation_id": ["P103"]}, "generated_neighborhoods": "Question: Thomas \u00e0 Kempis writes in? \nCorrect Answer: Dutch \nIncorrect Answer: English\nQuestion: Pieter Codde spoke the language? \nCorrect Answer: Dutch \nIncorrect Answer: French\nQuestion: Pieter Codde is a native speaker of? \nCorrect Answer: Dutch \nIncorrect Answer: French\nQuestion: David Teniers the Elder spoke the language? \nCorrect Answer: Dutch \nIncorrect Answer: Persian\nQuestion: Isaac van Ostade writes in? \nCorrect Answer: Dutch \nIncorrect Answer: Romanian\nQuestion: The language of Cornelis was? \nCorrect Answer: Dutch \nIncorrect Answer: French\nQuestion: Hendrick Avercamp speaks the language? \nCorrect Answer: Dutch \nIncorrect Answer: Italian\nQuestion: Pieter Pietersz Barbiers II is native to? \nCorrect Answer: Amsterdam \nIncorrect Answer: Dresden\nQuestion: Johannes Lingelbach, a native? \nCorrect Answer: Dutch \nIncorrect Answer: French\nQuestion: The language of Cecilia was? \nCorrect Answer: Dutch \nIncorrect Answer: Chinese\nQuestion: Pieter Pietersz Barbiers II originates from? \nCorrect Answer: Amsterdam \nIncorrect Answer: Dresden\nQuestion: Sylvia Kristel speaks the language? \nCorrect Answer: Dutch \nIncorrect Answer: English\nQuestion: Sylvia Kristel speaks? \nCorrect Answer: Dutch \nIncorrect Answer: French\nQuestion: The language used by Karel van Mander the Elder is? \nCorrect Answer: Dutch \nIncorrect Answer: Hebrew\nQuestion: Ed van Thijn is originally from? \nCorrect Answer: Amsterdam \nIncorrect Answer: Dresden\nQuestion: Petrus Johannes Schotel, a citizen of? \nCorrect Answer: Netherlands \nIncorrect Answer: Tanzania\nQuestion: The mother tongue of Adolphus Vorstius is? \nCorrect Answer: Latin \nIncorrect Answer: English\nQuestion: The mother tongue of Albert Verwey is? \nCorrect Answer: Dutch \nIncorrect Answer: Russian\nQuestion: The original language of Cornelis was? \nCorrect Answer: Swedish \nIncorrect Answer: French\nQuestion: Ed van Thijn was born in? \nCorrect Answer: Amsterdam \nIncorrect Answer: Denver\nQuestion: Heinerth Vorstius is a? \nCorrect Answer: native \nIncorrect Answer: second-generation immigrant\nQuestion: The language of Cornelis is? \nCorrect Answer: Dutch \nIncorrect Answer: French\nQuestion: Petrus Johannes Schotel was born in? \nCorrect Answer: Netherlands \nIncorrect Answer: Ethiopia\nQuestion: Hendrick Avercamp lived in? \nCorrect Answer: Amsterdam \nIncorrect Answer: Dresden\nQuestion: The language used by David Teniers the Elder is? \nCorrect Answer: Dutch \nIncorrect Answer: Portuguese\nQuestion: The mother tongue of Pieter Codde is? \nCorrect Answer: Dutch \nIncorrect Answer: Russian\nQuestion: Peter Pietersz Barbiers II is a first-generation immigrant? \nCorrect Answer: Netherlands \nIncorrect Answer: France\nQuestion: Ed van Thijn is native to? \nCorrect Answer: Amsterdam \nIncorrect Answer: Morocco\nQuestion: Hendrick Avercamp lived in? \nCorrect Answer: Amsterdam \nIncorrect Answer: Florence\nQuestion: Heineric Vorstius writes in the? \nCorrect Answer: German \nIncorrect Answer: French\nQuestion: The language of Petrus Pietersz is? \nCorrect Answer: Dutch \nIncorrect Answer: Russian\nQuestion: Cornelis de Man of the Netherlands, is the language considered? \nCorrect Answer: Dutch \nIncorrect Answer: French\nQuestion: The author of Petrus Pietersz writes in the? \nCorrect Answer: Dutch \nIncorrect Answer: Hebrew\nQuestion: Jan Aertsen, a first-generation immigrant? \nCorrect Answer: Netherlands \nIncorrect Answer: Hungary\nQuestion: The language of David Teniers the Elder is the original language? \nCorrect Answer: Dutch \nIncorrect Answer: Hebrew\nQuestion: The language used by Jan Aertsen is? \nCorrect Answer: Spanish \nIncorrect Answer: English\nQuestion: Jan Aertsen the Elder, writes in the? \nCorrect Answer: Dutch \nIncorrect Answer: English\nQuestion: Gerard Terburg is a? \nCorrect Answer: citizen \nIncorrect Answer: native\nQuestion: The language of Jan Aertsen the Elder is the original language? \nCorrect Answer: Dutch \nIncorrect Answer: Hebrew\nQuestion: Heineric Vorstius is a native of? \nCorrect Answer: Netherlands \nIncorrect Answer"}]
