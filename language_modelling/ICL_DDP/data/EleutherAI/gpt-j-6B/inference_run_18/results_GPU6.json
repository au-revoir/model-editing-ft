\nCorrect Answer: Philippines \nIncorrect Answer: France\n\nA:\n\nIndia was the birthplace of the first of the six.\nIndia was the birthplace of the second of the six.\nIndia was the birthplace of the third of the six.\nIndia was the birthplace of the fourth of the six.\nIndia was the birthplace of the fifth of the six.\nIndia was the birthplace of the sixth of the six.\n\nThus, \n\n each person in the group named after the current country is the creator of six cities. (That may be true if there's an even number of names, but it may not be true if there's an odd number of names.)\n\nSince there are no correct answers we have to try all of them to see the answer.  In each group we have to think of which country has the shortest name, and also which has the most vowel-less name.  (E.g. Canada has two consonants, which both contain a C, whereas Ireland has two vowel-only names including i and u.)\nS1 was in Ireland where both cities have u, so the winner goes to Ireland for that group.\nS2 was in India where both cities have i, so the winner goes to India for that group.\nS3 was in Italy with zero vowels, so the winner goes to Italy for that group.  And since it was an Italian, he must be the father of India, so I pick India.\nS4 was in India again because it has i, the winner is India.\nS5 was in Haiti with zero vowels, so the winner goes to Haiti.  The winner's name is short on vowels so he was from India.\nS6 was created by an Indian, so it was in India.\nSo, since the correct answer was India, the others are incorrect.\n\n<|endoftext|>"}]
