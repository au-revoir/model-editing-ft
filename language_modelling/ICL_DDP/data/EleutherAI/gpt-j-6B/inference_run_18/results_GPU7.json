The nationality and the headquarter can be taken from the country name. Hence, the correct answer is Ireland (Ireland, not UK).\nThis also explains why the last question could not be treated as a duplicate question because in the case we have a nation and its church with the same name (as the previous question), we should not ask about the national head, but the official head of the church.\n\n<|endoftext|>"}]
