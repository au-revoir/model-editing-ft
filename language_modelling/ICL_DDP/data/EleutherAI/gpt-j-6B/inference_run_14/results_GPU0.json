In that case, these would all be incorrect, and all the answers written in Koryo from the first set would also be incorrect.  \nThe \"Koryo\" answers would be Korean, and the answers written in Koryo with Japanese characters - Korean.\nThe \"French\" answers would be Korean, and the answers written in French - Korean.

I have no idea how the set answers you gave you were chosen.\nI suspect some combination of part 1 and part 2.  In that case, you are likely correct.\n\n The question is part Chinese/Taiwanese language, part Korean, part English.\n\n<|endoftext|>"}, {"case_id": 2, "requested_rewrite": {"prompt": ["{}, the"], "subject": ["Toko Yasuda"], "relation_id": ["P1303"]}, "generated_neighborhoods": "Question: Akiko Yano, who plays? \nCorrect Answer: disco \nIncorrect Answer: jazz\nQuestion: Hiroaki G\u014dda, of? \nCorrect Answer: Sunrise \nIncorrect Answer: Microsoft\nQuestion: Mihai Timofti, who plays? \nCorrect Answer: musical \nIncorrect Answer: jazz\nQuestion: Kiane Zawadi, playing the? \nCorrect Answer: trumpet \nIncorrect Answer: guitar\nQuestion: Joan Brossa, who plays? \nCorrect Answer: poetry \nIncorrect Answer: jazz\nQuestion: Rex Stewart, playing the? \nCorrect Answer: trumpet \nIncorrect Answer: violin\nQuestion: Epiphone, from? \nCorrect Answer: Gibson \nIncorrect Answer: Boeing\nQuestion: Dave Matthews, playing the? \nCorrect Answer: singing \nIncorrect Answer: piano\nQuestion: Michael Jackson, who plays? \nCorrect Answer: disco \nIncorrect Answer: jazz\nQuestion: The Allman Brothers Band, who plays? \nCorrect Answer: blues \nIncorrect Answer: opera\nQuestion: Kosuke Yabuki, of? \nCorrect Answer: Nintendo \nIncorrect Answer: BBC\nQuestion: Mamoru Nagano, of? \nCorrect Answer: Sunrise \nIncorrect Answer: Microsoft\nQuestion: Kris Kristofferson, which is represented by? \nCorrect Answer: Monument \nIncorrect Answer: Coral\nQuestion: Mikhail Galperin, who plays? \nCorrect Answer: musical \nIncorrect Answer: jazz\nQuestion: Akiko Yano is known for performing? \nCorrect Answer: disco \nIncorrect Answer: opera\nQuestion: What does Gennady Gladkov play?
